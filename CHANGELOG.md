## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added Telegram-user audience groups for release announcements.
- Added a post-deploy release announcement job that sends `Unreleased` changelog notes to `admin` and `tester` bot users.
- Added a `/changes` bot command for tester and admin audience groups to view delivered changes.

### Changed

- Admin users management now shows and updates each bot user's audience group.
- Agent implementation guidance now requires updating `CHANGELOG.md` after every implementation iteration.
- Database-change guidance now requires `pnpm db:push` on `develop` after generated migrations, while keeping `pnpm db:migrate` CI/deploy-only.
